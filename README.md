# Web-DataVisualization
DataAnalytics (Web Assignment 11)

## Task

For this task we take dataset and build a creative visualization dashboard website .

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 10 pages total, including:

* A landing-page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
  
* Four visualization-pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  
* A comparisons-page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.    
    
* A data-page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.  
 
* An about-page that:
  * Displays information related about desgin and designer.
  
    
The website, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
